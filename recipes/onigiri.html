    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Onigiri rice balls. Rice balls in Japan are like sandwiches in western countries. Easy to make, easy to take them out on a picnic. It's very popular in Japan as a light meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>⅔ cup short-grain rice, rinsed</li>
        <li>⅔ cup water</li>
        <li>3 sheets nori (dry seaweed), cut into 1-inch strip</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine rice and water in a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid. Soak for 20 to 30 minutes. Cover and bring to a boil over medium heat. Once water is boiling, reduce heat to low and cook until water is completely absorbed, 12 to 13 minutes. Remove from the heat; keep covered and steam for another 10 minutes. Remove lid and cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Wet your hands and form small amounts of rice into triangle shapes if possible, or round balls. Wrap each onigiri with a strip of nori. Season with salt and garnish with sesame seeds and seaweed flakes.</li>
